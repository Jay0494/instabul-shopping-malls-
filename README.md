**Introduction**
The analysis of sales data from multiple malls in Istanbul between 2021 and 2022 provides insights into sales growth, customer preferences, payment trends, and the performance metrics of individual malls. The overall analysis highlights the general economic environment, changes in consumer behavior, and opportunities to improve performance.

In the data cleaning process, I standardized the data to ensure consistency, making it easier to analyze and interpret. This involved harmonizing formats for dates, values, and text entries. After standardization, I organized the data into fact and dimension tables. Fact tables focused on measurable sales data (like revenue, units sold, and sales dates), while dimension tables categorized supporting details (like customer demographics, payment methods, and product types).

**Recommendations**

1. **Boost Performance in Low-Traffic Malls**:
   - Emaar Square Mall should implement targeted marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships to attract more customers and recover from its sales decline. Consider hosting events or introducing unique retail experiences.
   
2. **Capitalize on High-Performing Product Categories**:
   - Continue focusing on clothing, shoes, and technology, as these categories are consistently driving revenue. Expanding product lines or offering exclusive deals could further increase sales.

3. **Optimize for Demographics**:
   - Since adults and middle-aged adults are the primary customers, tailor promotions and store layouts to their preferences. Consider adding family-friendly amenities to attract the teenage and young adult segments.

4. **Payment Method Incentives**:
   - Introduce promotions for credit and debit card users to balance out the reliance on cash payments. For example, offer cashback rewards or discounts for non-cash transactions.

5. **Manage Seasonal Sales Volatility**:
   - Develop seasonal campaigns to counteract the typical sales declines observed in certain months. For instance, pre-emptive marketing ahead of downturns could maintain sales stability.
